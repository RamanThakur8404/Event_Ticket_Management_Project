## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later)
* Maven
* MySQL Server
* Node.js (for the frontend)
* npm (Node Package Manager)

### üíª Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/RamanThakur8404/Event_Ticket_Management_Project.git](https://github.com/RamanThakur8404/Event_Ticket_Management_Project.git)
    cd Event_Ticket_Management_Project
    ```

2.  **Configure the Backend**
    * Navigate to the `server` directory.
    * Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
    * Update the `spring.datasource` properties to point to your local or remote MySQL database. You will need to create a database schema for the project first.
    ```properties
    # src/main/resources/application.properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_event_db_schema
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**
    Navigate to the `client` directory and install the required packages.
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once the installation and configuration are complete, you can run the application.

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    From the `server` directory, run the following Maven command:
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application**
    From the `client` directory, run:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now register a new user, create events, and book tickets through the web interface.
